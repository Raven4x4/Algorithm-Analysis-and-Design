# Algorithm-Analysis-and-Design
This repository contains the implementation and performance analysis of various sorting algorithms. The project aims to evaluate and compare the efficiency of different sorting algorithms using different types of datasets.

# Introduction
The "Algorithm-Analysis-and-Design" project aims to analyze and compare the performance of various sorting algorithms. The project evaluates the efficiency of these algorithms using datasets of different characteristics, including sorted, random, and reversed data.

# Algorithms
The project includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array into two halves.
- Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
# Dataset
The datasets used for analysis include:

- Sorted Data: A dataset where elements are sorted in ascending order.
- Random Data: A dataset with elements in random order.
- Reversed Data: A dataset where elements are sorted in descending order.

#Results
The results of the performance analysis will include:

- Execution time (in milliseconds) for each algorithm on different dataset sizes.
- Comparison of performance across sorted, random, and reversed datasets.
